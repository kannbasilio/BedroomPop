# Bedroom Pop

This is my video game, Bedroom Pop, an ear training tool for musicians. 

All the art and sounds in this game are my own, with the exception of the title screen song, which was produced by lukrembo. 
This project was built with Unity. The sprites were drawn in Aseprite, and the music was composed in GarageBand. 

This game has three different stages, fit for musicians of all experience levels. 
I currently have the medium stage published, in which players have to hear and repeat a sequence of three notes. 

I've shared this with my instructors and peers in my music theory class, and I hope it can help others as well!
